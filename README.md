# Sorting_Algorithm_Comparisons
Comparing Sorting Algorithms time based off of number in array\n
The goal of this project is to be able to observe and compare the sorting Algorithms given by our textbook.

The objective is to use these sorting algorithms, 

Exchange Sorts (bubble, Selection, Insertion)

Quick Sort (Recursive and Optimized versions)

Shellsort

Heapsort

Mergesort(Recursive vs Optimized)

RadixSort

and compared them based off of a random list filled with n= 100 1000 10,000 100,000 etc. for up to 5 sizes

the sizes I chose were n = 100 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 10,000,000
